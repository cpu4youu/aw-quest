<h3>What is Alien Worlds Quest?</h3>
  <p>A weekly quest system designed to bring more players to Alien Worlds, more value to Veles as well as exposure to other games. Together we can make WAX an even more interesting place to be!

In this questing system players need to complete tasks from different games to earn a part of the prize pool. Of course the focus will be on Alien Worlds and especially VELES. </p>

<br>
<h3>What is the Prize Pool?</h3>
  <p>100,000 TLM of the weekly allocation will be converted into VELES tokens. This is the prize pool players of Alien Worlds Quest will compete for.  </p>
  
<br>
<h3>What is the Qualification?</h3>
  <p>To qualify for payout from the weekly quests you will need to mine at least 20 times on VELES, as well as hold a certain amount of VELES tokens. The more VELES tokens a player holds, the more can be earned by completing quests up to a maximum which may be around 10000 VELES. This is to incentivize players to keep holding their tokens, bringing more value to VELES as a planet in return.   </p>
  
<br>
<h3>What are the Quests?</h3>
  <p>Games can apply with Alien Worlds Quest to have certain actions from their game listed as a quest. This could be: "Evolve a Beast" in Beast Garden or "Win a Death Rally" in Nova Rally. The player will receive points for each completed quest. This gives exposure to other games on WAX but also forces players from the game to play Alien Worlds if they want to take part in Alien Worlds Quest.  </p>
  
<br>
<h3>How does the Payout work?</h3>
  <p>At the end of the week the players will get their share of the prize pool. Lets say 5,000 players managed to gain 1,000,000 points in total. The players called "ShrimpBaguette" managed to earn 450 points this week. This means that ShrimpBaguette gets 0.045% of the total prize pool. So from 100,000 VELES tokens he will get 45 tokens for this week. Players will have 4 weeks to claim their tokens before they get auto-collected by the aw-quest account. The auto-collected VELES tokens can then be used to simply increase the value of the planet.  </p>
  
<br>
<h3>How does this all work?</h3>
  <p>The games which list quests notify the aw-quest smart contract whenever a quest was completed by a player. Our Smart Contract will then be able to track which player completed which quests automatically. 

We will build a website where players can login, browse the quests and see what they have open and completed for this week. In addition we will allow games to setup an easy way to allow players to purchase the NFTs they need to get started with their game.  </p>


<br>
<h3>What games will be on the platform?</h3>
  <p>We are actively looking for projects that may be interested and want to join us. Please reach out to admin@aw-quest.com for consideration. For now we already have 4 partnerships but we intent to launch with just 2 at the start.  </p>
